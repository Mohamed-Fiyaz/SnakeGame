This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## How to Play

- Use the following keys to control the snake's movement:
  - `W` for up
  - `S` for down
  - `A` for left
  - `D` for right
- The snake will move continuously in the chosen direction.
- The objective is to eat the red food that appears randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
- Be careful not to run into the screen borders or collide with your own body, as that will end the game.
- The game speed increases slightly after eating each piece of food.

- Snake's movement responds to keyboard input.
- Food appears at random positions.
- Score and high score are displayed on the screen.
- The game resets when the snake collides with the screen borders or itself.
- The game gets progressively faster as the snake eats more food.
